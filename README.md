### Exploratory Data Analysis 
Question 1.
Which survey questions did respondents agree with or disagree with most?

Question 2.
Do you see any patterns or trends by department or role?

Question 3.
As an employer, what steps might you take to improve employee satisfaction based on the survey

### Data Analysis
pivot tables was used to summarize data and data visualization

### Result
Most employees agreed with qestion 1, that is they knew what was expected from them at work
 Most employees disagreed with question 6, that is, they disagreed that they have a best friend at work. Most employess however, strongly disagreed that they have received recognition or praise for doing good work in the past 7 days

 most employees that gave complete responses for the survey were from Planning and public works department. This is however expected because most employess were from this department.

 the survey shows that most employees were not recognized or praise for doing their jobs in the past 7 days. As an employer, I will create room for motivating and rewarding employees who performed well at work. employees who perform exceedingly well will be rewarded with Employee of the week/month and this individual will be given bonuses/incentives. This will motivate other employees to put in their best at work.
